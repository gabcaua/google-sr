# google-sr-selectors

Set of html selectors for parsing google search results

<Callout type="info" emoji="🕵️‍♂️">
   Please note that the included selectors are intended for the non-Javascript version of Google Search page. 
   These were obtained by appending `&gbv=1` to the regular query link.

   ex: (disable javascript, else it will redirect): [query `nodejs`](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=nodejs&gbv=1)

## Installation

> Not yet released

```sh npm2yarn
npm i google-sr-selectors
```

## What are selectors?

Selectors form the backbone of packages like google-sr. These are predefined strings that outline the structure of specific HTML code representing the desired value. 
By utilizing selectors, we gain the ability to parse the HTML and precisely extract the intended information.

This document outlines the selectors used to extract search result values from, html page data we receive
for purposes of contributors and other developers interested in parsing raw google search html

<Callout type="default" emoji="🛠️">
   Google can update its HTML structure periodically, which could potentially disrupt the functionality of the package. 
   While we do run a github action to test the package periodically, we may take time to patch package.

   If you suspect that Google has updated all or some selectors and we have not yet patched the package, please [create a github issue](https://github.com/typicalninja/google-sr/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=[BUG]%20Selectors%20outdated).
