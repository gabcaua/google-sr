```

# Usage

### Simple example

You can easily perform a single-page search like this:

```ts
import { search } from 'google-sr';

search({ query: 'nodejs' }).then(console.log);

// or if using await/async
const searchResults = await search({ query: 'nodejs' });
console.log(searchResults);
```

## Important Notes üö®

* google-sr scrapes the HTML of Google search results. This means it relies on Google's predefined HTML structure. If Google changes this structure, the package might seem to behave unexpectedly. To avoid this, it's best to keep your package updated to the latest version. (Note: we may take time to update it to any new structure)

* Fetching multiple pages can be slow, we recommended either fetching only small amount (i.e 5 max) or fetching pages in chunks as needed using specific page control of `searchWithPages` function
