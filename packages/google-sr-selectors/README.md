Please note that the included selectors are intended for the **non-Javascript** version of Google Search page. 
These were obtained by appending `&gbv=1` to the regular query link.

ex: (disable javascript, else it will redirect): [query `nodejs`](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=nodejs&gbv=1)

## What are selectors?

Selectors form the backbone of packages like google-sr. These are predefined strings that outline the structure of specific HTML code representing the desired value. 
By utilizing selectors, we gain the ability to parse the HTML and precisely extract the intended information.

This package exports the selectors used to extract search result values from, google html page data we receive.
Offered for purposes of contributors and other developers interested in parsing raw google search html.

## Supported types

The package currently only supports a limited amount of selectors

You can view them in the [documentation](https://g-sr.vercel.app/google/selectors)
